              run : node -v 
            - name : Install Dependencies
              run : npm ci     #this will install the dependencies and ci means clean install it will install exact latest available version related to your work for dependencies 
            - name : Run tests

#this was the first one below :-

              #run : | 
                #echo "cloning repo ..."
                #echo "${{toJson(github)}}" #tgis github means its github actions context and we shoud write in this format
                #git clone https://github.com/${{github.repository}}.git #it will clone it into your repository.
                  

#now the above method is quite difficult there is another method go to google search github actions marketplace.
#go to market place and search there checkout click on it and scroll down go to usage and start doing
